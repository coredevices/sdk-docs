title: Pebble SDK 3.8-beta12 - Changelog
date: 2015-12-14
---

This is a pre-release version of the Pebble SDK. Only changes since beta10 are included.

### Changes to Firmware

* ``graphics_fill_radial`` will now produce dithered 50% gray on Aplite where appropriate.
* Fixed an issue causing reduced stack availability after using dictation.
* Slightly reduced stack usage in general.
* Added support for 3.8 to 2.9 downgrades (but no data is retained when doing this).
* Restored the missing "Call back" button to iOS missed call pins.
* Improved stability.


### Changes to SDK

* Fixed an issue causing SDK 3.8 apps to install on firmware 3.6 and 3.7, but then
  potentially crash at runtime. They now display a compatibility error when launched.
