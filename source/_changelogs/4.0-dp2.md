title: Pebble SDK 4.0-dp2 - Changelog
date: 2016-06-22
---

This is a developer preview release of SDK 4.0. No firmware is provided.

### Changes to Firmware

* Fixed a bug causing ``APP_GLANCE_SLICE_NO_EXPIRATION`` to mean "expire immediately"
  rather than the intended "expire never".
* Fixed a bug causing empty app glances (i.e. attempts to remove all glances) to be
  ignored.

### Changes to SDK

* None.

### Known Issues

* The `UnobstructedAreaHandler` object must be created before being passed into
  the `unobstructed_area_service_subscribe` method.
* The Diorite emulator is still a little shy and will occassionally shake upon
  starting. If your emulator doesn't stop shaking, try installing an app - that
  usually brings it out of its shell.
