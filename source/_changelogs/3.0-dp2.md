title: Pebble SDK 3.0-dp2 - Changelog
date: 2015-03-05
---

This is the second Developer Preview release of Pebble SDK 3.0.

We have updated the Aplite SDK to include some macros that make developing apps
for both platforms easier. For example, you can now use `GColorEq` on both
Aplite and Basalt and the SDK will take care of the platform differences. 

## Detailed List of Changes:

### Changes for Firmware:

Multiple stability improvements.

### Changes for SDK Tools:

* Running the Pebble emulator on Mac OS X will no longer use up 100% CPU.
* Apps built with 3.0-dp2 will install correctly on iOS
* Fixed `png2pblpng` for case of 1 color causing bitdepth of 0.

### Changes for Examples:

*No changes*

### Changes for Documentation:

*No changes*
