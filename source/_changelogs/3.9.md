### Changes to SDK

* Added the new [Health API](/guides/events-and-services/health/)!
  * This enables you to read information from Pebble Health and include it in your
    app or watchface.
* Added support for multiple JavaScript files! Check out
  [the blog post](/blog/2016/01/29/Multiple-JavaScript-Files/) for more details.
* Fixed an issue introduced in 3.8.2 causing some _successful_ font builds to hang
  the build process indefinitely.
* Added ``PBL_IF_MICROPHONE_ELSE``, ``PBL_IF_SMARTSTRAP_ELSE``, and
  ``PBL_IF_HEALTH_ELSE`` macros, for consistency with ``PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE`` and
  friends. This also includes new `PBL_MICROPHONE`, `PBL_SMARTSTRAP`, and
  `PBL_HEALTH` defines.
