title: Pebble SDK 3.14 - Changelog
date: 2016-07-06
---

This firmware was released only for the Pebble Time series.

### Changes to Firmware

* Adjusted the Health alerts to be more positive and less condescending.
* "Average" is now "Typical", to match the phone apps.
* Improved the smart alarm algorithm.
* Improved syncing of health data to the phone.
* Fixed a potential crash loop when receiving unexpected ANCS data on iOS.


### Changes to SDK

* Added ``PBL_API_EXISTS`` macro, to test whether a function exists in a given 
  SDK at compile time. This macro will also be added to the 4.0-dp3 preview.
* Fixed a bug that caused messageKeys containing an underscore to be mangled.
