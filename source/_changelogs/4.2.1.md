This is a hotfix for [SDK 4.2](/sdk/changelogs/4.2/). No corresponding firmware exists.

### Changes to Firmware

None.

### Changes to SDK

* Removed the use of `eval` in JavaScript bundling that was causing incorrect behavior
  when running in the emulator and on iOS.

* JavaScript errors do not have a useful filename or line number. You may find it helpful
  to look up the line in build/pebble-js-app.js to determine what the error is referring to.
