title: Pebble SDK 3.8.1 - Changelog
date: 2015-12-16
---

This release is currently SDK-only. In particular, the timeline text color
fix will not be available on watches until we ship a new firmware build
~~later this~~ next week.

### Changes to Firmware

* Fixed a timeline crash that only occurred on Aplite when run in an SDK
  emulator in a release build.
* Fixed timeline `foregroundColor` being used inappropriately in the
  timeline list view, sometimes leading to white-on-white text.

### Changes to SDK

* None
