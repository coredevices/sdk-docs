title: Pebble SDK 3.0-dp3 - Changelog
date: 2015-03-13
---

This is the third Developer Preview release of Pebble SDK 3.0.

We have slightly modified the build process in this release to separate out
logs from Aplite and Basalt when building your app. 

In order to take advantage of this change, you will need to update your wscript.
The easiest way to do is to create a new project and copy the wscript.

## Detailed List of Changes:

### Changes for Firmware:

* Multiple stability improvements.

### Changes for SDK Tools:

* Separated Aplite, Basalt and bundling log output when building an app.
* Added new [`hiddenApp`](/guides/tools-and-resources/app-metadata/) 
  property to appinfo.json.

### Changes for Examples:

Updated examples with new wscript.

### Changes for Documentation:

* Multiple improvements to various 3.0 documentation, including fixing broken
links and undocumented function parameters.
