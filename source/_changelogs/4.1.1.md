title: Pebble SDK 4.1.1 - Changelog
date: 2016-09-29
---

This is a hotfix for [SDK 4.1](/sdk/changelogs/4.1/). No corresponding firmware exists.

### Changes to Firmware

None.

### Changes to SDK

* Fixed a build failure when using only tagged icons.
* Fixed a failure to validate the correct icon or published resource when using tagged resources.

### Known issues

* ``health_service_metric_accessible`` always returns `false` when
  checking the accessibility of ``HealthMetricHeartRateBPM``.
  Instead, use
  `health_service_metric_aggregate_averaged_accessible(HealthMetricHeartRateBPM, time_start, time_end, HealthAggregationAvg, HealthServiceTimeScopeOnce)`
