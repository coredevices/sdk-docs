      <p>
        Here at Pebble we are big believers in the power of open source. Our
        firmware is <a href="/blog/2014/10/10/FreeRTOS-Modifications-From-Pebble-v2/">built upon FreeRTOS</a>,
        and all of our mobile and web applications make use of many different
        open source libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever possible, we like to give back to the open source community,
        so here are just some of our open source projects available for anyone
        to use in their own work.
      <p>
        You can also check out our GitHub profile at
        <a href="https://github.com/pebble/">https://github.com/pebble/</a>.
